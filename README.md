# NBAMachineLearning
Used machine learning to predict NBA salaries

As my second machine learning project, I decided ADD MORE HERE

better data collection process 


Side Note: If you look at the my code for actually collecting the data, you'll notice I got data from the past 3 seasons of the NBA. My code doesn't do this all at once, rather I wrote generic code for getting one year's worth of data, and I can then update a few parameters to do the same with a previous year. I did this because it was a bit faster and easier to implement, at least compared to the process I was going to originally use to get data from all 3 years. I don't think my data collection process was the greatest, but I am new to it and expect to have a better approach in the future.
