# NBAMachineLearning


As my second machine learning project, I decided to use use machine learning to predict NBA salaries. I collected player stats from the past 5 years, and used them to predict salaries. My final algorithm was off by an average of over 4 million, which is admittedly not amazing. A larger training set (mine had 772 examples) would allow for more accuracy, as well as looking at non stat related features, like age or injury history.
